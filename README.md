**Project: Smart Thermostat Simulation for Energy and Cost Trade-offs**

Simulate a smart thermostat to maintain comfort (20°C–24°C) and  predict electricity cost.
Used Scilab sine function to model 24-hour outside temperature (25°C–35°C) and thermostat (If-else) logic 
Result: Room stayed within comfort range; cost rose during evening peak hours due to high cooling demand.
Learning: How simple models can balance multiple objectives, of adaptiveness and decision making
